    "# Model Predictive Control\n",
    "Model predictive control (MPC) is an advanced concept for feedback control of a digital control system leveraging computational power and accurate modeling. The general idea in MPC is to solve an optimization problem anew at each timestep, making use of the just-received feedback data from sensors. The processor of the computer that updates the input signal to the plant must be able to solve this optimization problem within the time duration of one timestep, so the optimization problem cannot be too complex. The optimization problem can even be generalized to find the values of multiple controlled inputs to the plant for multivariable control, handled in a single computer program. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will see how a single time step’s control update is calculated. We’ll use a simple linear system as our plant. This system was used for the controller proposed by E. B. Dahlin [1]."

    "This differential equation could describe a physical mass-spring-damper mechanical system or a resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuit electrical system or other second-order linear systems. From the coefficients, we can determine that this is a stable and overdamped system. An instantaneous step up in the input signal u(t) from 0 to 1 will take about 20 seconds for our system to respond by moving from 0 to 0.95, which is almost 1. Adding a feedback controller such as MPC can make the controlled “closed-loop” system to have a faster response to a step change in its input signal than the uncontrolled “open-loop” system."

If we select a perfect step response as our reference, we will have difficulty evaluating the controller because that response is not physically achievable. A mass cannot be moved a displacement instantaneously without infinite energy. Instead of dealing in the infinite, let us use a reference trajectory for our system which is achievable: a first order system response. We choose a time constant tau_c for a desired first order response. Recall that a first order system reaches about 95% of its full step response in a period of time equal to about three times the time constant. If we set tau_c to 1, then we expect a response of our system to 95% in 3 seconds, which is fast compared to the 20 seconds we saw above for the open-loop system.\n",
