    "- **Interpreting color-coded results:** Colors often represent values on a scale, where shades of red may indicate areas of high stress or temperature, and blue may signify low values. This immediate visual feedback allows engineers to quickly identify areas of concern.\n",

These patterns guide engineers to areas needing closer inspection or redesign.\n",
    "- **Comparing simulation results to design criteria:** Engineers use these visualizations to assess whether the simulated performance meets predefined thresholds, such as staying within the material's yield strength or avoiding temperatures that might cause thermal damage. For instance, if a stress map shows red regions exceeding the material's ultimate tensile strength, redesigning the component or selecting a stronger material becomes necessary."
