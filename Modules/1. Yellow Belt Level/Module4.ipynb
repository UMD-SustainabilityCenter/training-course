    "### Module 4: Modeling and Simulation\n",
    "Modeling and simulation involve the creation of models (e.g., physical, mathematical, behavioral, or logical representation of a system, entity, phenomenon, or process) as the foundation for simulations to develop data utilized for managerial or technical decision making.\n",

    "#### Concepts:\n",
    "- **Traditional Engineering Analysis (FEA):** Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a computational method used to predict how products will react to forces, vibration, heat, and other physical effects, allowing for optimized design and validation before physical prototypes are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../img/13.jpg\" alt=\"Alt text\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advanced multi-physics modeling and simulation:** This involves the simultaneous simulation of multiple interacting physical phenomena (e.g., thermal, mechanical, electrical) to predict the behavior of complex systems more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../img/14.jpg\" alt=\"Alt text\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CAM tools and build simulations:** Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) tools assist in the planning, control, and management of manufacturing operations, while build simulations predict the manufacturing process and outcomes, ensuring efficiency and precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data driven models:** These models use data analytics and machine learning algorithms to predict system behavior and performance based on historical and real-time data, enhancing decision-making and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../img/15.jpg\" alt=\"Alt text\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Physics based data models:** These models combine physical laws and empirical data to simulate and predict the behavior of systems under various conditions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of system performance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Generative models:** Generative models automatically create optimized designs based on specified constraints and performance criteria, enabling innovative solutions that might not be discovered through traditional methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System Models:** System models represent the interactions and relationships between different components of a complex system, allowing for comprehensive analysis and optimization of the entire system's performance.\n",
