    "- **Traditional Engineering Analysis (FEA):**\n",
    "  Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a computational method used to predict how physical phenomena like stress, heat, and vibration affect materials and structures. Engineers use FEA to create models that simulate these effects and help them understand potential weaknesses or points of failure. The focus is on interpreting the outputs of FEA, such as stress/strain plots and heat maps, rather than on running the simulations themselves.\n",

These models analyze historical data to predict future outcomes, such as equipment failures or quality control issues. By identifying patterns and trends, data-driven models enable proactive maintenance and continuous improvement, leading to increased efficiency and reduced downtime.\n",
