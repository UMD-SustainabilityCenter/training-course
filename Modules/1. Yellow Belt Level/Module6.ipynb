    "## 6.1 Definition of Digital Twins\n",
    "A digital twin is a virtual replica of a real-world object, system, or process that serves multiple purposes, including simulation, testing, monitoring, and maintenance. The digital twin concept has gain increased attention in recent years. Various application- specific digital twin definitions have been proposed to capture the nature of digital twin in these domains. \n",

    "For instance, a well-accepted definition of digital twins in the aerospace domain is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### *A Digital Twin is an integrated multiphysics, multiscale, probabilistic simulation of an as-built vehicle or system that uses the best available physical models, sensor updates, fleet history, etc., to mirror the life of its corresponding flying twin (Glaessgen and Stargel 2012)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "VanDerHorn and Mahadevan (2021) proposed a consolidated and generalized definition of digital twin as \n",
    "> #### *A virtual representation of a physical system (and its associated environment and processes) that is updated through the exchange of information between the physical and virtual systems*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A most recent defition of digital twins by the National Academy of Engineering; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in their report **Foundational Research Gaps and Future Directions for Digital Twins** defines digital twins as follows\n",
    "> #### *A digital twin is a set of virtual information constructs that mimics the structure, context, and behavior of a natural, engineered, or social system (or system-of-systems), is dynamically updated with data from its physical twin, has a predictive capability, and informs decisions that realize value. The bidirectional interaction between the virtual and the physical is central to the digital twin*.\n",

    "## 6.2 Digital Twins v.s. Digital Model v.s. Digital Shadow\n",
    "Digital twins can encompass the entire lifecycle of an object and use real-time data from sensors to simulate behavior and monitor operations. By incorporating machine learning and advanced analytics, digital twins provide valuable insights and support informed decision-making, enhancing efficiency, and optimizing performance throughout the lifecycle.\n",
    "The distinction between a digital model, a digital shadow, and a digital twin is unclear in many cases. Many people are confused about these three different concepts.\n",

    "- **Digital model:** It means modeling an object digitally. For instance, Computer-aided design (CAD) is a widely used digital modeling technique where 3D objects are created from a number of 2D drawings using computer software.\n",
    "- **Digital shadow:** It is an evolving digital representation that mirrors the current state and behaviour of a physical entity or system. For instance, the CAD model can be used in a finite element analysis software to predict the stress response of a structural system. As the load condition changes, the finite element model can dynamically predict the stress states of the structural system.\n",
    "- **Digital twins:** As been pointed out by the definition of digital twins of the National Academy of Engineering; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, **the bidirectional interaction between the virtual and the physical is central to the digital twin**. The bidirectional interaction sets digital twins apart from digital model and digital shadow.\n",

    "### <font color = '#646464'>6.4.2 Digital Twins for Additive & Subtractive Manufacturing</font>\n",
    "The process of additive manufacturing (3D printing) often results in parts that deviate from their original CAD design specifications due to inherent manufacturing limitations, leading to inaccuracies and out-of-tolerance areas. To achieve precision and adherence to original design specifications, a reliable method is required to identify and correct these deviations post-printing, integrating additive manufacturing, precision scanning, and subtractive machining processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This user story demonstrates digital twin principles by integrating additive manufacturing, laser scanning, and subtractive machining into a cohesive workflow. Initially, a precise 3D CAD model is created and exported as an STL file, which is then sliced and printed via additive manufacturing (3D printing). Due to inherent inaccuracies in the additive process, the resulting physical part often deviates from the exact dimensions specified in the CAD model. To address this, a Gocator laser scanner captures a precise 3D profile of the printed part. The scanned data is compared against the original STL model to detect any deviations or errors. Areas found to exceed tolerance limits‚Äîmanifesting as protrusions or inaccuracies‚Äîare identified and marked for correction. The next stage involves generating an optimized machining path specifically targeting these out-of-tolerance areas. Dedicated algorithms process the scanned data and produce precise cutting coordinates to remove only the protruding sections. These coordinates are then translated into machine-readable G-code instructions. The final subtractive machining step utilizes these instructions, allowing a CNC-capable 3D printer equipped with appropriate cutting tools to accurately mill and correct the identified deviations, ultimately producing a final part that closely adheres to its original CAD specifications.\n",

    "Selective laser melting (SLM) is a widely utilized technique in additive manufacturing for creating metal components with intricate geometries and high precision. However, its practical adoption is limited by inconsistent process reproducibility and unreliable product quality. This highlights the urgent need for in-situ quality monitoring and real-time process control. In this particular user story, digital twin techniques can be used to combine acoustic emission signals with photodiode signals for in-situ quality monitoring. Based on 2D porosity and 3D density measurements, digital models can be constructed to predict part quality. Based on the multi-sensor fusion method for quality monitoring, process control can be conducted to ensure the quality of the manufactured product using digital twins.\n",

    "One representative application that demonstrates a digital twin‚Äôs capability in adaptive decision support is mission planning. For example, the figure below show the real-time mission planning of off- road autonomous ground vehicles using a digital twin model. These vehicles operate in highly stochastic, harsh, and uncontrolled off-road environments. A high-fidelity digital model of an off-road autonomous ground vehicle has been developed as part of the modeling and simulation effort of the U.S. Army Ground Vehicle Systems Center. The digital model predicts vehicle mobility under different terrain conditions and allows for the generation of a probabilistic mobility map. The mobility map provides critical information for real-time path planning of off-road autonomous vehicles.\n",
