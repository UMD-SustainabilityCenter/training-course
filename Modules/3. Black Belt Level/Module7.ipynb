Predictive maintenance models can identify patterns indicative of potential issues by analyzing historical data, such as sensor measurements and equipment performance. This allows maintenance teams to schedule repairs or replacements in advance, reducing costs associated with unplanned downtime and improving overall operational efficiency.\n",
