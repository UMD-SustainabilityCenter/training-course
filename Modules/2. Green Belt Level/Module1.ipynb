Summary statistics offer a concise way to summarize the essential characteristics of numerical data, and they are foundational in exploratory data analysis (EDA).\n",

    "- **Central Tendency**: This refers to the measures that represent the center or typical value of a dataset. The most common measures are:\n",
    "  - **Mean**: The average value of the data, calculated as the sum of all data points divided by the number of data points.\n",
    "  - **Median**: The middle value when the data is sorted in ascending or descending order. It is less sensitive to outliers than the mean.\n",

    "  - **Standard Deviation**: This measures how much individual data points differ from the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates that the data is more spread out.\n",
    "  - **Variance**: The square of the standard deviation, representing the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n",

Since the standard deviation for both is low (2.0 K for air temperature and 1.5 K for process temperature), it indicates that temperature variability is minimal. This shows that the environment is well-controlled, which is essential for maintaining consistency and quality in the manufacturing process.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Rotational Speed Variance**: The range of rotational speeds (from 1168 rpm to 2886 rpm) and a relatively higher standard deviation (179.88) suggest that there is a considerable amount of variability in the rotational speeds. This could indicate either operational adjustments or different machine settings used during production.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Torque Variability**: Torque values range from 3.8 Nm to 76.6 Nm, with a standard deviation of 9.97. This significant variability indicates that torque fluctuates considerably, likely due to varying operational demands or changing material conditions during production.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tool Wear Range**: Tool wear shows a wide range, from 0 to 253 minutes, with a high standard deviation (63.66). This suggests that the amount of tool wear varies significantly, possibly due to differences in machine usage intensity or maintenance practices.\n"
