    "In our inventory data, inconsistency and duplicates occur in both the **product names** and **quantities**. For example, the product \"gearbox model A\" is listed with different formats such as `\"gearbox model A\"`, `\"Gearbox Model A\"`, `\"gear-box model A\"`, and `\"GearboxA\"`, all of which represent the same item but are written differently. This inconsistency makes it difficult to track the total quantity of this product. Similarly, there are duplicates in product names, such as `\"bearing 123\"` appearing three times with different formatting (`\"bearing_123\"`, `\"Bearing 123\"`, and `\"Bearing_123\"`) and `\"motor model X\"` listed twice with slightly different names (`\"motor model X\"` and `\"motor_x\"`). These inconsistencies and duplicates lead to incorrect aggregation of quantities, making it hard to accurately manage inventory and potentially causing errors in production planning or inventory reports.\n",
