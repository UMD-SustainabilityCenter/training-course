    "## 5.1 Definition\n",
    "Model-based process control is a mathematical and visual technique to addressing the challenges associated with designing complex control. This technique involves two key aspects. (a) The control analysis, representing the modeling and simulation aspects of the system including tuning and configuration, and automatic code generation. Each block of the model contains mathematical equations that emulate the behavior of the physical system. (b) The system and software, representing continuous validation and verification through testing, and deployment of the system. In this regard, when model-based control is used efficiently, it offers a single design platform to enhance overall system design. Through virtual prototyping, system engineers can easily see whether the whole system is working as intended, even before the hardware is manufactured and available for testing.\n",

    "Application: Pumped fluid storage is a common method to \"even out\" the fluctuating demand for a fluid such as a coolant or process water.\n",
    "A cooling example is the liquid cooling of a portable generator. \n",
    "The generator may be automatically throttled up or down in power due to fluctuating demand and to conserve fuel and prolong runtime.\n",
    "This throttling necessitates control of the flow rate of coolant.\n",
    "Similarly, a process water example of evening out flow is in the feeding of water into a once-through steam generator for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or creation of an enhanced geothermal system (EGS).\n",
    "In these techniques, the steam generator, shown above, is brought to a site for injection of the produced steam into a well in the ground.\n",
    "An energy source boils the water to produce steam and supplies the steam at a specified pressure and flow rate to the application such as an underground oil formation or  geothermal energy formation under development.\n",
    "Steam demand, and hence process water demand, may fluctuate due to physical conditions in the underground formation or due to the operating state of the steam generator."

    "In a pumped fluid storage application, a pump supplies water to a network of two cylindrical tanks for fluid storage or delivery to a process with variable demand. The pump injects water into the larger fluid tank, which is connected to a smaller tank by a shutoff valve (maintained in the open position during process operation).\n",
    "The smaller tank is connected to the process by another shutoff valve (also maintained in the open position during process operation).\n",
    "We will use $q$ for flow rate, $h$ for height of water in a tank, $A$ for tank cross-sectional area, and $R$ for hydraulic flow resistance. \n",
    "Flow resistance is defined as pressure divided by flow rate, $R = \\Delta P / q$, in which $\\Delta P$ is the fluid's pressure drop across the hydraulic element, such as a valve, in the direction of flow.\n",
    "We assign an inlet flow rate $q_\\text{input}$ from the pump into the larger tank, labeled tank 1.\n",
    "The valve between tanks 1 and 2 is labeled with flow resistance $R_1$ and flow rate $q$.\n",
    "The smaller tank is labeled tank 2.\n",
    "The valve after tank 2 is labeled with flow resistance $R_2$ and flow rate $q_\\text{output}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model based control approach is sought to decide how to operate the pump (how to specify flow rate $q_\\text{input}(t)$ so that the output flow rate $q_\\text{output}(t)$ achieves the desired output flow rate $q_\\text{output, desired}(t)$. This control approach can use sensors to sense the height of water ${h}_1(t)$ or ${h}_2(t)$ in either tank or the flow rate $q(t)$ between tanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The volume of water in tank 1 is $A_1 h_1$, and likewise, the volume of water in tank 2 is $A_2 h_2$.\n",
    "By conservation of volume, the net flow of water into tank 1 is $q_\\text{input} - q$. This must equal the rate of change of the volume of water in tank 1, which is $\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(A_1 h_1\\right) = A_1 \\dot{h}_1$.\n",
    "Notice that the overdot indicates a time rate of change, and that the cross-sectional area of the tank is not changing in time while the height of the water column in the tank is changing in time.\n",
    "You might pronounce $\\dot{h}_1$ as \"H one dot\".\n",
    "For tank 2, the net flow of water into tank 2 is $q - q_\\text{output}$.\n",
    "So we have two differential equations governing our system:\n",
    "$$q_\\text{input} - q = A_1 \\dot{h}_1$$\n",
    "and\n",
    "$$q - q_\\text{output} = A_2 \\dot{h}_2$$\n",
    "Our dynamic system is not yet complete as we must relate $q$ to some combination of the input signals $q_\\text{input}$ and $q_\\text{output}$ or state variables ${h}_1$ and ${h}_2$.\n",
    "We get this equation from the definition the flow resistance for the valve between the tanks.\n",
    "We need to know the pressure drop between the tanks.\n",
    "In each tank, the pressure at the bottom of the tank is $P = \\rho g h$, in which $\\rho$ is the density of the fluid, water, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n",
    "So the pressure difference from the bottom of tank 1 to the bottom of tank 2 is $\\Delta P = \\rho g \\left(h_1 - h_2\\right)$.\n",
    "We now have an equation for $q$, which is $\\Delta P = \\rho g \\left(h_1 - h_2\\right) = q R_1$.\n",
    "We isolate $q$ as:\n",
    "$$q = \\frac{\\rho g}{R_1} \\left(h_1 - h_2\\right)$$\n",
    "We substitute this $q$ into our system of two differential equations as:\n",
    "$$q_\\text{input} - \\frac{\\rho g}{R_1}h_1 + \\frac{\\rho g}{R_1}h_2 = A_1 \\dot{h}_1$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\rho g}{R_1}h_1 - \\frac{\\rho g}{R_1}h_2 - q_\\text{output} = A_2 \\dot{h}_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It would appear that we can control both water column heights using both of the input signals.\n",
    "However, the objective is to supply a specified (desired) flow rate of water at a specified pressure.\n",
    "Let's examine the second valve (the valve between tank 2 and the outlet that feeds water into the process).\n",
    "The flow resistance equation for this valve is $\\Delta P = R_2 q_\\text{output}$. \n",
    "We know the pressure at the bottom of tank 2 is $\\rho g h_2$. \n",
    "The pressure of the water at the outlet should be the process's desired pressure, $P_\\text{output}$, which we will assume to be a static variable (consant in time).\n",
    "Without loss of generality, let us assume this is the ambient pressure $P_\\text{output} = 0$.\n",
    "So, the flow resistance equation for the valve becomes:\n",
    "$$\\rho g h_2 = R_2 q_\\text{output}$$\n",
    "This means that $h_2(t)$ and $q_\\text{output}(t)$ cannot be independently controlled.\n",
    "The value of one determines the value of the other through the preceding equation.\n",
    "So our system of two differential equations can be combined into one in which one of the tank height variables is eliminated.\n",
    "The other tank height variable can be eliminated by using the relationship between $h_2(t)$ and $q_\\text{output}(t)$, giving the following differential equation from $q_\\text{input}(t)$ to $q_\\text{output}(t)$.\n",
    "$$\\ddot{q}_\\text{output}\\left[A_1 A_2 \\frac{R_1}{\\rho g} \\frac{R_2}{\\rho g} \\right] + \\dot{q}_\\text{output}\\left[A_1 \\frac{R_1}{\\rho g} + A_2 \\frac{R_2}{\\rho g} + A_1 \\frac{R_2}{\\rho g} \\right] + q_\\text{output}\\left[ 1 \\right] = q_\\text{input}$$\n",
    "In this equation, the double dot notation above a variable indicates a second derivative with respect to time.\n",
    "Also, square brackets are used so as to avoid confusion with the notation for functions of time.\n",
    "We see that the system is a second-order system in the output variable $q_\\text{output}(t)$. \n",
    "We can design a closed-loop controller for this second order system, which will result in a different transfer function for the closed-loop control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use new variables to simplify the coefficients of the system:\n",
    "$$a = A_1 A_2 \\frac{R_1}{\\rho g} \\frac{R_2}{\\rho g}$$\n",
    "$$b = A_1 \\frac{R_1}{\\rho g} + A_2 \\frac{R_2}{\\rho g} + A_1 \\frac{R_2}{\\rho g}$$\n",
    "$$c = 1$$\n",
    "So that the second order system is:\n",
    "$$\\ddot{q}_\\text{output}\\left[a \\right] + \\dot{q}_\\text{output}\\left[b \\right] + q_\\text{output}\\left[ c \\right] = q_\\text{input}$$\n",
    "with transfer function:\n",
    "$$\\frac{Q_\\text{output}}{Q_\\text{input}}(s) = \\frac{1}{as^2+bs+c} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "When a closed loop controller with proportional gain $K$ is used, the closed loop transfer function becomes:\n",
    "$$\\frac{Q_\\text{output}}{Q_\\text{output,desired}}(s) = \\frac{K}{as^2+bs+c+K} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach for designing this control system (the approach we used in the yellow belt level of this module) was to design a second order transfer function to have the damping ratio $\\zeta$ and natural frequency $\\omega_n$ which we specify.\n",
    "This is a valid approach once again.\n",
    "It would involve writing the transfer function as:\n",
    "$$\\frac{Q_\\text{output}}{Q_\\text{input}}(s) = \\frac{\\frac{K}{a}}{s^2+\\frac{b}{a}s+\\frac{c+K}{a}} $$\n",
    "Then equating the denominator $s^2+\\frac{b}{a}s+\\frac{c+K}{a} = s^2+2\\zeta\\omega_n s+\\omega_n^2$.\n",
    "From there, algebra gives:\n",
    "$$\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{c+K}{a}}$$\n",
    "$$\\zeta = \\frac{b}{2a\\omega_n} = \\frac{b}{2a}\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{c+K}} $$\n",
    "The speed of response is approximated by the time constant for a second order system $\\tau \\approx \\frac{1}{\\zeta\\omega}$.\n",
    "For this system,\n",
    "$$\\tau \\approx \\frac{1}{\\frac{b}{2a\\omega_n}\\omega_n} = \\frac{2a}{b} $$\n",
    "So the speed of response doesn't depend on $K$ in this analysis, but rather on the design parameters that set $a$ and $b$ such as the cross-sectional areas of the two tanks and the flow resistances of the two valves.\n",
    "We see that the choice of $K$ specifies the damping ratio $\\zeta$, and so the level of overshoot and oscillation of a step response.\n",
    "In general, these ranges for $\\zeta$ describe the systems step response:\n",
    "* $\\zeta>1$: overdamped system with no overshoot or oscillation, but slow response\n",
    "* $\\zeta=1$: critically damped system with no overshoot and no oscillation\n",
    "* $0.7<\\zeta<1$: underdamped system with faster response and slight overshoot without oscillation\n",
    "* $0<\\zeta<0.7$: underdamped system with fastest response but significant overshoot and oscillation\n",
    "* $\\zeta=0$: marginally stable system with undamped oscillating response. This is not physcially realizable as the slightest perturbation will cause the system to move into either the stable ($\\zeta>0$) or unstable ($\\zeta<0$) regime.\n",
    "* $\\zeta<0$: unstable system whose step response grows to infitinty, possibly with oscillations between large postive and large negative values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also specify the static gain of the system by evaluating its transfer function for $s=0$, giving $\\frac{K}{c+K}$. \n",
    "We see that the static gain is near 1 (unity) when $K\\gg c$ (meaning $K$ is far greater than $c$), giving low error at steady state.\n",
    "However, low values of $K$ relative to $c$ will have a static gain below 1 and thus will have significant steady state error between the demanded and actual water flow rate.\n",
