    "Selective laser melting (SLM) is a widely utilized technique in additive manufacturing for creating metal components with intricate geometries and high precision. However, its practical adoption is limited by inconsistent process reproducibility and unreliable product quality. This highlights the urgent need for in-situ quality monitoring and real-time process control. A feature-level multi-sensor fusion method is introduced, combining acoustic emission signals with photodiode signals for in-situ quality monitoring in SLM's intelligence-driven production. An off-axis monitoring system with a microphone and photodiode captures process signatures during building. Based on 2D porosity and 3D density measurements, the collected acoustic and optical signals are categorized to indicate part quality. Considering laser scanning data, a method is developed to transform 1D signals into 2D images, which are then used to train a convolutional neural network to extract and merge features from both sensors. Compared to several baseline models, the proposed multi-sensor fusion method delivers superior performance in quality monitoring.\n",

    "\n",
    "316 L stainless steel powders with a size distribution between 15 and 37 Œºm were used in this work. Experiments were conducted in an inhouse SLM machine (FastForm-140) equipped with a fiber laser, operating in a continuous mode and producing a maximum 250 $W$ nominal output power. The range of the scanning speed is $0‚Äì7 m/s$, and the powder bed could be preheated to $200^‚ó¶C$. The maximum build part volume of the machine is $120 √ó120 √ó120 mm^3$. The airborne acoustic emission signal of the process zone is captured by a free-field standard microphone (G.R.A.S. 46AE 1/2‚Ä≤‚Ä≤CCP), with a frequency range of 3.15 Hz‚Äì20 kHz (¬±2 $dB$) and a sensitivity of 50 $mV/Pa$. The light intensity signal in the wavelength range of 500‚Äì1700 nm emitted during the building process is collected by a photodiode (C10439-11). The selected photodiode is an InGaAs type of photodiode with a $Œ¶3$ mm photosensitive area.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the experiments, three samples with the same size of 10 mm √ó10 mm √ó5 mm were built under each process condition. One of the three parts was randomly selected to measure the porosity. Since it is difficult to observe all build layers for porosity, four cross-sections perpendicular to the building direction were observed and measured. The average porosity of these sections, spaced about 300 Œºm apart, was calculated. Each cross-section was analyzed using a metallographic microscope, with five local regions observed at 50x magnification. The captured images were analyzed for porosity using ImageJ software, and the sum porosity of the five regions was used as the final porosity for each layer.\n",
