    "## Fundamentals of Digital Engineering:\n",
    "Digital engineering is an integrated digital approach that uses authoritative sources of systems data and models as a continuum across disciplines to support lifecycle activities from concept through disposal. At its core, digital engineering evolves creating comprehensive digital (computer) models that represent every characteristic of a complex product or system that is to be developed. Originally designed for hardware-intensive lifecycle management, digital engineering also proves highly effective for software applications. Complex systems often depend on multiple subsystems operating simultaneously and in concert, known as a system of systems (SoS). This concept applies to both software and hardware-intensive systems. While integration challenges exist for both, the process for managing and scheduling hardware and software integration can differ significantly. Digital engineering addresses these challenges by providing a cohesive framework that ensures efficient and coordinated lifecycle management across all system components.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <img src=\"img/01.png\" alt=\"Alt text\" width=\"900\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital engineering is sometimes referred to as “digital thread”, which encompasses a broader scope. Although the novelty of both terms has led to some debate, they are fundamentally extensions of product lifecycle management. This practice involves creating and storing a system's lifecycle artifacts in digital form, which can be updated as the system evolves. Both digital thread and digital engineering involve a single source of truth, referred to as the authoritative source of truth (ASoT). This ASoT contains all lifecycle artifacts in a centralized repository, ensuring that stakeholders work from the same models rather than multiple copies. The emerging processes of digital thread and digital engineering aim to address the difficulties of managing complex and evolving technologies over their lifecycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital engineering has an ambitious scope: managing the entire lifecycle of a system of systems, including both hardware systems and software components. Its emphasis on simulation and modeling offers significant benefits in hardware engineering alongside software engineering. By promoting the use of virtual models in tandem with, or prior to, constructing physical systems, digital engineering aims to improve efficiency, efficacy, and success. An offshoot of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), digital engineering seeks to accelerate the development of complex products, systems, and sub-systems. It achieves this by integrating various engineering disciplines and addressing each unique engineering challenge comprehensively. \n",
    "\n",
    "One application example of digital engineering is the digital twin, which is a software simulation that mirrors the operation of a physical system. These digital twins can also simulate software, reflecting the interdependence of physical and software components. Digital twins can be used to reduce the time, money, and power required to test and iterate on the design of novel technologies. In its current state, digital engineering is new and relatively unrecognized as an industry term.  The introduction of new standards and practices from digital engineering may come full-circle and influence the way that software is currently built, placing a larger emphasis on the modeling and simulation of software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this training course is to familiarize the audience with the concepts and tools necessary for digital engineering, as well as the current challenges in the field. In contrast to traditional text/image-based course material, this course utilizes Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate the concepts and tools interactively. The format allows participants to practice these concepts at their own pace on an open-source platform. The course modules are designed to cater to a diverse audience (novices, learners and practitioners) accommodating various levels of experience and interest."

    "\n",
    "Model-based definition (MBD) is a process that uses 3D models within CAD software to define product assemblies and individual components comprehensively. The model is annotated with non-geometric information, such as dimensions, materials, finishes, tolerances, and symbols, that are important for manufacturing and inspection. The model becomes the source of authority for all engineering activities and is used in downstream processes like manufacturing, inspection, and assembly. MBD can offer several benefits, including: (a) Reduced engineering documentation time: Compared to drawing-centric workflows, MBD can reduce the time spent on engineering documentation, (b) More efficient drafting process: When designers designate critical dimensions, weld callouts, and notes in the model before passing it on to drafters, there's less back-and-forth between the two, allowing drafters to have all the information they need as soon as it's ready, (c) Improved communication and collaboration: MBD can improve communication and collaboration among stakeholders, and (d) Cost savings: efficiencies gained through MBD lead to substantial cost savings.\n",
